# Employee-Attrition-Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze employee attrition trends within a company. Using machine Learning models and Power BI visualizations, we identify the key factors that contribute to employee attrition and predict whether an employee is likely to leave the organization.

## Key Features
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing using Python
- Machine Learning models used: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM
- Model fine-tuning using **RandomizedSearchCV**
- Power BI Visualizations to show insights
- Documentation on model performance comparison and visual insights

## Technologies Used
- Python: 	for data preprocessing, machine learning, and model evaluation
- Pandas: 	for data manipulation
- scikit-learn: for building machine learning models
- Power BI: 	for creating dashboards and visual insights from the data
- Git & GitHub: for version control and project management

## Project Structure
- `Employee_Attrition_Analysis.ipynb`: Python notebook with data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- `Employee_Attrition_Dashboard.pbix`: Power BI dashboard showcasing key visual insights.
- `WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv`: CSV file is the dataset used for the project.
- `Documentation.docx`: Project documentation detailing the process, models, and findings.
